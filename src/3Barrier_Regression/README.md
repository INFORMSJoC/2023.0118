BarrierUpOutCallBS.m BarrierUpOutCallBSRev.m and VanillaCallBS.m are about the exact value (such as $V_0$ and the true value).

Reset.m is about the figure.

NestedEsti.m is used to generate the samples (about the outer-level samples and inner-level samples.

RegEsti.m calcluate the regression coefficient using regression.

RegResultBUaO.m calcluate the estimates for three loss.

RunRegResultBUaO.m repeat the estimates for many times to calculate the empirical MSE.

Users can adjust different d (denote the number of the stocks) in the RunRegResultBUaO.m, the corresponding true value is obtained from the fold 'TureValue_3Barrier_Option'.
